## Notes

This package includes a patch to rename the desktop entry and executable to `js8call-improved` to avoid conflicts with the original `js8call` package.

This is a bit of future proofing because settings do conflict with the current 2.2.0 version of the `js8call` package.
We may replace the `conflicts` with `provides` depending on how the future development of `js8call-improved` goes. 
I noticed them chaning the exe name back to js8call after the 2.4.0 release.
